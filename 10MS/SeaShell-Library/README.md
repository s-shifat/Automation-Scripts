# SeaShell Library

This is a library I wrote to help me complete the automation tasks in 10 Minute School. While completing the tasks, I found myself writting similar functions
for some particular tasks like converting presentation slides to png/jpg formats, sending automated emails to clients etc. So I noted all those tasks and ended
up writing up this library. This made my life a lot easier, and increased the productivity exponentially.

This library is well documented. So if you write google apps script to combine services provided by Google, then this library will reduce your pain.
