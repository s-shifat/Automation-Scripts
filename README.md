# Automation Scrpts

This repository conatins most of my automation scripts.
These scripts are client and task specific. Most of them are written for repetitive tasks of *Robi Ten Minute School*.<br>
Thus, this repository is mainly used to share my automation scripts with my clients.

### Repository Structure
The repository is devided into several sub-directories. Each are intended for different projects. Every sub-directory will contain a `README.md` file describing 'how to use'.

### Exactly What is/are Automated?

Well currently bulk of my work contains either *Microsoft Office* or *Google Products* automation using languages like *Visual Basic for Applications*, *Python*, *Google Apps Script* etc.
